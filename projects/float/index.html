<h1>Business Info/Promotion App (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floatapplication">Google Play</a>)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My friend and I built Android application where users can open up shops and place a marker on the map to promote there buisiness locally. 
Users can interact with shops owners using a built in instant messaging and search up items using the search bar(supports elastic search)
  or "infinite" product scrolling. More details availiable at 
  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floatapplication">Google Play</a>. </p>

<h2>Backend</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The backend was bulit using Node.js Docker containers following a microservice design pattern.</p>

<h3>Api-gateway</h3>
<h4>Functionality</h4>
<ul class="Functionality">
				<li>Most app requests are made to the api-gateway which routes requests to the appropriate microservices</li>
				<li>Handles basic User Authentication such as checking JWT for tasks that require permission<br></li>
				<li>Maintains data consistancy across services <br>
          Some app requests incorporate many services and to achieve modulation services do not communicate with each other. 
          As a result, the api-gateway schedules requests to multiple services however a request to a certain service may fail and to maintain
	  data consistancy previous requests must be reverted by the api-gateway. <br>
          For example, when a user requests for sign-up the api-gateway:
	  <br>
          1.Request to auth-service to create user
					<br>
          2.Request to user-service to create user profile
					<br>
          3.Request to chat-service to generate xmpp account
					<br><br>
          However, if any of these steps fail to achieve atomicity transactions must be reverted. The api-gateway uses a 
					“saga state machine” to achieve such goal and maintain data consistency over distributed services. 
          For the above example if transaction #3 fails the saga state machine reverts transaction #2 and #1.
          </li>
				</ul>

  <h3>Auth-service</h3>
  <h4>Functionality</h4> 
	<ul class="Functionality">
		<li>1.Stores usernames and hashed passwords using the node.js <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt">Bcrypt library</a></li>
		<li>2.Sends out emails with verification codes to users upon sign-up and handles the process

		<br><br>
		<li>3.Verifies OAuth tokens and grants refresh token and access token <br>

	</ul>
      
   <h3>Chat-service(<a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/chatbot/">Details and demo video</a>)</h3>
      <h4>Functionality</h4>
      <p>Has access to the MySQL database connected to ejabberd-service(XMPP) which allows custom http requests that
      the ejabberd framework does not support. For example, unread messages and dialogs lists cannot be synced among 
      multiple devices however adding the chat service makes such features possible. Also,
      this service handles are push notifications when users are offline.</p>
      
   <h3>Ejabberd-service(<a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/chatbot/">Details and demo video</a>)</h3>
      <h4>Functionality</h4>
      <p>A xmpp framework used to add instant messaging in the app. Enabled features are:
	    <ul class="chat_features">	  
        <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html">Stream Connection</a> allows detection of user disconnection for push notifications</li>
        <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html">Push Notifications</a> allows messages to be sent to user when disconnected</li>
	<li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html">Message Archiving</a>, <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html">Message Carbons</a> allows real time message data syncing across multiple devices</li>
	<li>TLS 1.2 encryption with a self-signed certificate(application only trusts the server)</li>	    
	</ul>
      
   <h3>User-service</h3>
    <p>Stores data of user such as profile image, shop ownership, name</p>

   <h3>Image-service</h3>
   <p>Stores image files and checks permissions of a request if image is private. Images names are stored using a MD5 hashes.</p>

   <h3>Shop-service</h3>
   <p>Stores data of shops and products in shops</p>

   <h3>Map-service</h3>
   <p>Stores data of shop markers on the map. The markers are stored and queried using mongo’s geospatial queries.</p>
