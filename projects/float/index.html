<h1>Float: Map Oriented Marketplace Application (<a href="https://gitlab.com/JarvisAPI/float">Gitlab</a>)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My friend and I collaborated on building an 
	<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floatapplication">Android application</a>
	through which users can <a href="/projects/float/login.jpg">login</a>, 
	<a href="/projects/float/shop.jpg">establish a shop(s)</a> 
	and <a href="/projects/float/shop_markers.jpg">place a marker on a map</a> through which promote their shop(s). 
	Users can also interact with other users using <a href="/projects/float/messaging.jpg">in-app instant messaging</a>, 
	search for items using a <a href="/projects/float/elastic_search.jpg">search bar</a>,
	or browse products using <a href="/projects/float/infinite_product.jpg">"infinite" product scrolling</a>.
	This project was built from scratch referencing various online resources and documentation. 
	More details are available at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floatapplication">Google Play</a>.</p>

<h2>Demo/<a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/chatbot">Detailed Messaging Demo</a></h2>

<h3>Why We Built It</h3>
<p>During my junior year, I enrolled in classes that covered a wide range of topics including software engineering,
	networking, databases, data structures and algorithms. These classes were mostly theory-based, but I was
	also interested in working with practice-based applications. As such, I decided to build something that
	could potentially be developed into a marketable product. Teaming up with a friend who had similar interests,
	we proceeded to develop a product that would help local small businesses and individuals promote their shops
	and interact with customers, all within a single application.</p>

<h3>Development Process</h3>
<p>As our first step, we researched how to build servers, what frameworks to use, and ways to set up the development environment.
	We started with small sub-projects and built our way up to bigger projects, solving the challenges we came upon one
	at a time. There were times when it took hours, and even days to solve technical problems, but the joy that came
	from solving a problem pushed us on towards the next challenge. I worked on the project part-time through the school
	year, and devoted full-time attention to it during the summer and winter breaks. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>Overall, I had fun working on this project and learned a lot about technologies and technical 
	concepts that were not taught to me in school. The most fulfilling moments came throughout 
	the process when we conceptualized, explained and eventually assembled and implemented working features.
	As a result of this project, I discovered my particular passion for back-end development, and it has solidified
	my plan to pursue a career in back-end software development. This project is no longer under development.
</p>

<!-- <h3>Possible Monetization/Product Design</h3>We planned to monetize this project and build a start-up by sending out local ADs or offering special
	shop markers or shop store front displays for a fee.-->
<h3>Product Design</h3>
<p>We tried to technically understand
	similar crowdsourcing products such as Kijiji, Craigslist, Yelp, 
	Letgo, Varagesale, and wanted to create something different and unique.</p>

<h3>My Contributions</h3>
<ul class="contributions">	  
        <li>Designed, implemented, and tested RESTful APIs (api-gateway, chat, auth, user, image, map services)</li>
        <li>Built application components from front-end to back-end (login, messaging, user profile, shop components)</li>
	<li>Set up and integrated frameworks such as Docker, MySQL, Firebase, XMPP, OAuth</li>
	<li>Wrote Docker, Docker-compose files, as well as shell scripts to automate deployment and testing</li>
	<li>Wrote integration and unit tests</li>
	<li>Implemented user session mechanism with JWTs as well as user authentication</li>
	<li>Set up HTTPS, TLS(XMPP) for client and server</li>
	<li>Built UI and app illustrations</li>
	<li>Version control</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>The backend was built using Node.js Docker containers following the
	<a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html">microservice design pattern</a>, 
	that was inspired by a YouTube video,
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ3wIuvmHeM">"Mastering Chaos - A Netflix Guide to Microservices"</a>.</p>

<h3>Api-gateway</h3>
<ul class="Functionality">
	<li>All app requests except instant messaging requests are made to the api-gateway,
		which is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate services</li>
	<li>Handles basic user authentication such as checking access tokens for tasks that require permission<br></li>
	<li>Handles distributed transactions: <br>
          Some application requests incorporate many services and,
		in order to achieve modulation services, do not communicate with each other. 
		As a result, the api-gateway is in charge of scheduling requests to multiple services.<br>
          For example, when a user requests for sign-up the api-gateway:
	  <br>
          1.Requests to auth-service to create user
					<br>
          2.Requests to user-service to create user profile
					<br>
          3.Requests to chat-service to generate a xmpp profile
					<br><br>
		
         However, if any of these steps fail to achieve transaction atomicity, previous requests that were made must be reverted. The api-gateway uses a 
	  <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html">“saga state machine”</a> to handle such tasks and maintain data
		consistency over distributed services. For the example above, if transaction #3 fails, the saga state machine
		reverts transaction #2 and #1.
          </li>
				</ul>

  <h3>Auth-service</h3>
	<ul class="Functionality">
		<li>Stores usernames and hashed passwords using the Node.js <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt">Bcrypt library</a></li>
		<li>Verifies passwords and grants a refresh and access token(JWT) <br>
	</ul>
		<h4>Authentication & User-session Handling</h4>
	<img src="auth_user_session.jpg" alt="auth_user_session" height="550px" width="600px"></li>
	<h4>Security</h4>
	<ul class="Functionality">
		<li>Https is enabled using a self-signed certificate and only the server has the private key</li>
		<li>The client app only trusts the server</li>
  		<li>Upon login the the server returns a refresh token and so the client's password is only used once</li>
  		<li>The JWT is generated using an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm(rs256) and only the server has the private key</li>
		<li>User passwords are hashed using multiple salt rounds</li>
	</ul>
	
      
   <h3>Chat-service(<a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/chatbot/">Demo Video and Details</a>)</h3>
      <p>The chat-service has access to the MySQL database that is connected to Ejabberd-service (XMPP),
	      which allows custom http requests that the Ejabberd framework does not support. For example,
	      unread messages and dialog lists cannot be synced among multiple device using only XMPP. However,
	      by adding such a service, it makes these features possible. Also, this service handles
	      push notification message delivery to users when they are disconnected from the XMPP server.</p>
      
   <h3>Ejabberd-service(<a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/chatbot/">Demo Video and Details</a>)</h3>
      <p>A XMPP framework Ejabberd was used to add an instant messaging functionality. <br>Enabled features are:
	    <ul class="chat_features">	  
        <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html">Stream Connection</a>, which enables real-time detection of user disconnection</li>
        <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html">Push Notifications</a>, which enable messages to be sent to users when they are disconnected</li>
	<li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html">Message Archiving</a>, <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html">Message Carbons</a>
		, which enable real-time message data syncing across multiple devices</li>
	<li>TLS 1.2 encryption with a self-signed certificate (application only trusts the server)</li>	    
	</ul>

   <h3>User-service</h3>
   <p>Stores and handles requests for user data such as profile image uri, background image uri, shop ownership, name.</p>

   <h3>Image-service</h3>
   <p>Stores and handles requests for image files and its permissions. Image names are stored as MD5 hashes.</p>

   <h3>Shop-service</h3>
   <p>Stores and handles requests for shop data such as its products, cover images.</p>

   <h3>Elastic-Search-service</h3>
   <p>Handles app search requests made from the <a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/float/elastic_search.jpg">app search bar</a>.
       Search requests are proxied from the shop-service.</p>

   <h3>Map-service</h3>
   <p>Stores and handles requests for shop locations on the map. Locations are stored and queried using mongoDB’s geospatial queries.</p>
