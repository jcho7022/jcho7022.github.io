<h3>How I Built It</h3><p>I built the chatbot model following a <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/chatbot-deep-learning-python-tensorflow/">Tutorial</a>. 
The model is based on 170 million reddit comments that I pre-proccessed using python and sqlite.
Training the model took 1 week with a GTX 1080ti. After training I put the model in a tensorflow docker container and used a python 
  <a href="https://docs.zombofant.net/aioxmpp/devel/">XMPP library</a> to deploy it. When a request comes the text is inputed in the tensorflow
library which outputs 30 suggested replies. Afterwards, a python library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-Levenshtein/">Levenshtein</a>
is used to score the replies and the program responds with the output with the highest score.</p>

<h2>Messaging Service</h2>
<h3>Server(Node.js, MySql, XMPP(<a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">Ejabberd</a>), Docker)
<br>Android App(Java, Sqlite, XMPP(<a href="https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack">Smack</a>))</h3>
<h3>What I built</h3>
<p>A real time messaging service that enforces strict data consistancy over multiple devices.</p>

<h3>Message Syncing Between Devices using <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">Message Archive</a>, HTTP</h3>

<h4>How I Built It</h4>
<h4>Server</h4>
<p>Using the Docker version of an XMPP framework <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">Ejabberd</a> I enabled the module archive messaging and 
connected it to a MySql database. Every time a message is passed in before delivering it to the recipient Ejabberd archives the message into the database.
 For archiving the dialog list I set up a trigger in the MySql database such that when a archive message is inserted the dialog list for the user is also updated.</p>

<h4>Client</h4>
<p>Coded an application such that when the client app connects to the server the application pulls the archive messages and caches it in the application's Sqlite database.
When the user accesses the dialog activity the cached dialog list is displayed. When the user accesses the messages activity
the application queries the server for archive messages and caches the queried messaged on the app. The caching mechanism makes the messages load
faster leading to better user experience and less load on the server.</p>

<p>Real time message syncing between devices that is logged in with the same user id. Enabled on the server using Ejabberds module for the server and Smack on the application.</p>
