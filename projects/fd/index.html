<h1>Node Failure Detector(<a href="https://github.com/jcho7022/failure_detector">Github</a>)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The server that we used to deploy our 
  <a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/float">business application</a> which is located in my dorm room kept on crashing. So to monitor
  for crashes I built a failure detector using Golang and placed the monitor program in a AWS free tier node(Robust node). Whenever, our
server crashes the monitor program sends a email to me. This improved our servers up time.</p>
