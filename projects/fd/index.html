<h1>Node Failure Detector(<a href="https://github.com/jcho7022/failure_detector">Github</a>)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The server me and my friend used to deploy and develop our 
  <a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/float">business application</a> kept on crashing. So to monitor
  detect crashes I built a failure detector using Golang and placed the monitor program in a AWS free tier node(Robust node) monitoring 
  the server located in my dorm room. Whenever, our server crashes the monitor program sends a email to me. This improved server up time.</p>
