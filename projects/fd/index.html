<h1>Node Failure Detector(<a href="https://github.com/jcho7022/failure_detector">Github</a>)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Me and my friend bought a cheap processor on Craigslist that had problems with it's microcode. This caused a kernal panic every once and 
  a while leading to our server that we developed and deployed
  <a href="https://jcho7022.github.io/projects/float">business application</a> to crash. To monitor
  and detect crashes I built a failure detector using Golang and placed the monitor program in a AWS free tier node(Robust node) and monitored 
  our server located in my dorm room. Whenever, our server crashes the monitor program sends a email to me which improved server up time significantly.</p>
