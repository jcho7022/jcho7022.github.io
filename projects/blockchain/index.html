<h1>Distributed Blockchain Ledger (<a href="https://github.com/jcho7022/blockchain">Github</a>)</h1>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>Go, Docker</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Using Go I built a blockchain that can store text records and handle conccurent text transactions. 
  The leger stores records as events(event sourcing) and 
  iterates over the longest chain to retrieve text records a user owns.
